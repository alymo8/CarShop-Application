# CarShop-Application
A JavaFx application that can be used by a business to manage their appointments and services

For 3 months, my team and I worked on building this application from scratch. We built a system that can be used to manage how customers technicians and the owner access the application using the model-view-controller pattern. At the beginning we designed the UML and generated the system's basic code using Umple. Later on, we implemented the controller features to specify who can take an action and how actions are executed. After that we added a state machine to the Appointment class using Umple, so that the appointment status changes automatically when the user/owner try to change it. The last step was adding UI to the project. Here we decided to add the UI using JavaFx and fxml for the design.

The video below goes through most of the application's features rapidly

# CarShop-Application
A JavaFx application that can be used by a business to manage their appointments and services

For 3 months, my team and I worked on building this application from scratch. We built a system that can be used to manage how customers, technicians and the owner access the application, based on a UML diagram and a state machine we drew in Umple. Later, we added the UI, where we used JavaFx and FXML.

The video below goes through most of the application's features rapidly
